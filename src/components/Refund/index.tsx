            At [Your Store Name], we aim to provide high-quality product
            showcases for clothes, shoes, and more. We currently offer Cash on
            Delivery (COD) as our only payment method and do not process online
            payments. Please note that due to the nature of our service, no
            refunds are available after placing an order.

            We strive to ensure customer satisfaction through accurate product
            details and descriptions. However, since we do not facilitate online
            transactions or deliver physical products directly, refunds are not
            applicable after an order is placed via COD.

            <li>
              No refunds are provided after an order is placed, as our service
              is for product showcase and information only.

              Refunds are not available if you change your mind or decide not to
              proceed with the purchase.
            </li>
            <li>
              Since we rely on COD, no financial transactions are processed
              through our site, eliminating refund eligibility.
